# HKFrenchNumber

HKFrenchNumber was one of my personal projects done in 2013 and 2014.

It's a tool to translate digital numbers into French words. It supports three modes, TELEPHONE, CHEQUE and NUMBER. HKFrenchNumber can help French learners to read numbers, read telephone numbers and write cheques.
